# CAPSTONE_PROJECT_PROPOSAL

Project Name: Clever Child

Description/ Idea: 

A simplified and interactive educational system explicitly designed to serve and educate children aged 3 and above about Computer and Electrical Engineering basic concepts such as Binary Code, Logic Gates, building circuits, and electronic components. Parents are part of this journey where they can observe and track their children’s progress in selective courses based on their child's area of interest.

Inspiration:

“Children are the world's most valuable resource and its best hope for the future.”

― John F. Kennedy

Throughout my college years and while I was learning some computer/electrical engineering concepts, I wish I had known these concepts at a younger age. Because in childhood absorbing new concepts is much easier and faster. I would like to invest my time in creating an entertaining educational system that is valuable for the young generation and my son.
